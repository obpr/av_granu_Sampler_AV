#X text 19 130 [patch] is a tiny little abstraction that is used to
identify a patch so that Context communicate with it. [patch] takes
one symbol as a creation argument \, which is its identifier. If a
Context contains the same identifier in its :J setting (ie. " :J this-patch
") \, then its float-connections will only communicate with a Context
open in this patch. This is useful if you want to spread a network
over several patches and still be able to communicate between them.
;
#X text 20 259 As a little bonus \, [patch] lets you bring the parent-patch
to focus by sending a bang to its identifier. Ie. in another patch
than this one \, sending a bang to [send this-patch] would bring this
patch to the front.;

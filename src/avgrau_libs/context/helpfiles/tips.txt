HERE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW IF YOU WANT TO START USING CONTEXT:

1: To play Context, double click on the empty green area in the middle.


2: To stop Context, click and hold.


3: To resize Context, hold Shift and click + drag just outside the right / bottom border.


4: To enter the settings menu, right click and select 'properties'.


5: To return to the main view, press the button on the top right.


6: To change the timing, use the float atom on the top left.


7: To edit the message, use the symbol atom at the top middle.


8: The toggles along the bottom are called the PATTERN. They form a simple step sequencer.


9: The toggles along the right are called the BURST. They fire all together at the end of the cycle.


10: The outlets along the bottom are synced to the PATTERN.


11: The inlets along the top are all the same. They can be used to start Context and receive other commands.


12: To receive the messages that Context sends, create an object [receive cx-], where 'x' is the unique ID number of a Context shown near the top left corner--for instance, [receive c3-] to receive Context number 3. Don't forget the dash.


13: To receives messages from all Contexts, use [receive context-].

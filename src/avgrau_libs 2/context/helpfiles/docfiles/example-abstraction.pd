#X text 223 33 This abstraction contains just four objects: [slide]
\, [tog] [value] and [psave]. Creating these objects is all it takes
to achieve state-saving! Notice however that each object has \$1 somewhere
in its creation argument \, and that each instantiation of this abstraction
has a unique 'name' as a creation argument. See the individual help-files
of each object to understand their creation arguments.;
#X text 222 153 This abstraction doesn't do anything other than state-save
\, but you can of course easily connect the objects to other things
within the abstraction to do anything of your choice.;
#X text 96 240 The objects created here are: [slider volume v \$1 0

#X text 480 27 Rajiv is in charge of the whole thing. He's not playing
any music today--instead \, he's telling other people when to play
\, like a conductor in an orchestra. Every two seconds \, Rajiv counts
to four \, telling Gunter to start on one \, Megan on two \, Lilly
on three \, and then taking a rest. However \, every fourth time he
finishes this sequence \, Rajiv scrambles the order \, just to change
things up., f 54;
#X text 1023 10 Gunter is a pretty simple guy and likes to play drums.
He waits for a signal from Rajiv \, and them just keeps the beat \,
but also passes a message on to Felicia every time he finishes a cycle.
, f 33;
#X text 1067 102 When Felicia receives a signal from Gunter \, she
either plays an extra kick drum \, or tells Fei to play her snare.
, f 23;
#X text 1060 441 Michelle has a cassette recorder with a little recording
of a tabla. She is pretty nifty with this machine \, and can start
the playback from any point in the recording \, so long as there are
markers in the right place. This is what she does whenever she gets
the word from Chris., f 37;
#X text 992 563 Lilly isn't playing anything today--she's just passing
on messages. She takes orders directly from Rajiv and then passes them
on instantly to either Ebo \, Chris \, Jean Paul or Fei. Which one
of these she decides who to pass the message on to is completely random.
, f 44;
#X text 485 504 Jean Paul plays the melody. He is stuck with the same
four note pattern and only knows three notes on the scale \, but it's
up to him which of these he he plays. However \, he always follows
a rule: Whichever note he chose for the second note must also be played
for the third and fourth.;
#X text 687 580 Jean Paul also plays a role in telling the percussion
section what to do. Every time he finishes his melody \, he does one
of three things: he either tells Fei \, Megan or Gunter to change their
pattern a little bit., f 46;
#X text 454 433 Luke is a pretty freeform musician. Every time Megan
says go \, he takes a stab at the piano. Which keys he hits (and how
many) is pretty much random. For now though \, he's only hitting the
bass notes.;
#X text 450 352 Megan is just here to pass messages on from Rajiv to
Luke. She gives Luke a predefined pattern every time she is told to
\, but she also changes that pattern whenever Jean Paul asks., f 47
;
#X text 433 146 Fei plays the snare. She has a little pattern which
\, which she changes every time Jean Paul asks. It lasts only 3/4 of
the length of the standard bar length that the rest of the group has
agreed upon \, and she often likes to repeat as soon as she has played
a cycle every., f 48;
#X text 446 249 Chris generates a sequence of random numbers which
he sends to Michelle \, so that she can play it on her tape recorder.
Chris has a template for this sequence \, but each time he sends it
to Michelle \, he alters it slightly. He is also careful to tell Michelle
to stop at the end., f 42;

#X text 19 126 Imagine that it's Sunday and you've invited some friends
over to play some music. They're all competent musicians and can play
anything you want them to \, or even improvise on their on. Since they're
all friends \, they're also really good at communicating with each
other and following instructions. For instance \, you might say to
them \, "OK Steve \, whenever Betty hits her drum \, you play that
melody that I just taught you" \, or "Betty \, I'd like you to speed
up a little bit whenever Steve finishes his guitar riff".;
#X text 18 249 Since it's your party \, they're all going to play whatever
you want them to \, but you can also teach them to take the lead and
make their own decisions. So you might say \, "Arun \, you're in charge
of this section: I want you to keep time for all the others" \, or
"Hamid: when I say go \, I want you to play one of those two tape recordings
I just gave you.";
#X text 17 334 Because your friends are smart \, they can follow all
sorts of complicated instructions. For instance you might say \, "Betty:
Every third time you hear a C sharp \, I want you to tell Arun to remove
a random one of the notes from the piano section I first taught him.
Arun: You don't have to listen to Betty every time she tells you to
remove a note \, but when you eventually get down to only two notes
\, then go back to the original melody." And Betty and Arun would do
this for you!;
#X text 17 553 On the right is an example of a Context network in action.
Remember though \, if your house is big enough \, you could invite
a lot more friends than this!;
#X text 17 457 This is essentially what Context is: a group of friends
communicating and playing music together \, with you \, the host \,
telling them what to do. Unfortunately they don't speak English \,
so you're going to have to learn their language and idiosyncrasies
if you want to be able to direct them properly. But once you do this
\, the possibilities are practically limitless.;
#X text 1134 180 Ebo knows how to play three different patterns on
the hi-hats. Each time he finishes one \, he picks another one at random.
But he's also good at varying the length of his hits \, making sure
that the ones he plays closer together are shorter., f 21;
